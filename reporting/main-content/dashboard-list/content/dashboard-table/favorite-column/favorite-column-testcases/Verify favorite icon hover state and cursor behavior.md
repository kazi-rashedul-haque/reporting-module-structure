**Title:** Verify favorite icon hover state and cursor behavior.

**Test Steps:**
1. Login to the application as an authenticated user.
2. Navigate to the Dashboard List page.
3. Hover the mouse cursor over a favorite icon (star) in any dashboard row.
4. Observe the cursor change and any visual hover effects.
5. Move the cursor away from the icon and verify hover state is removed.
6. Test hover behavior on both favorited (black) and unfavorited (white) icons.
7. Verify hover behavior is consistent across all dashboard rows.

**Expected Result:**
- The cursor should change to a pointer (hand) when hovering over favorite icons.
- Visual hover effects should provide clear feedback that the element is interactive.
- Hover states should be applied and removed consistently.
- Both black (favorited) and white (unfavorited) icons should have proper hover behavior.
- The hover experience should be consistent across all favorite icons in the table.
