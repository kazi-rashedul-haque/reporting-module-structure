**Title:** Verify favorite functionality with rapid consecutive clicks.

**Test Steps:**
1. Login to the application as an authenticated user.
2. Navigate to the Dashboard List page.
3. Locate a dashboard with a white star icon (not favorited).
4. Click the favorite icon rapidly multiple times in quick succession (5-10 clicks).
5. Observe the icon state and any alert messages.
6. Wait for all processing to complete.
7. Verify the final state of the favorite icon.
8. Test the same scenario starting with a favorited dashboard (black star).

**Expected Result:**
- The system should handle rapid clicks gracefully without errors.
- The final state should be consistent and reflect the last valid action.
- No duplicate alert messages should appear for the same action.
- The system should prevent double-processing of the same request.
- No system errors or unexpected behavior should occur during rapid clicking.
