### Positive Use Cases:
1. User types in the search field:
   * The search input is enabled and visible.
   * User types a valid search term (e.g., "My Filter").
   * The search term is captured and used to filter or display relevant results.

2. User presses `Enter` after typing a search term:
   * After typing a search term, the user presses the `Enter` key, and the system triggers the onSearch function, showing the filtered results.

3. User interacts with the search icon:
   * The search icon is not interactable.

4. User clears the search term:
   * The user clears the search field, either by using the backspace/delete key. The system resets the displayed results.
   * The user can also click a clear button (X) to reset the search input.

5. User inputs a partial search term:
   * The input should accept partial terms and dynamically update the displayed results accordingly (e.g., typing `fil` to show `My Filter` and `Saved Filters`).

6. User focuses on the search input:
   * The input field should automatically be focused, allowing the user to start typing right away when the component loads.

### Negative Use Cases:
1. User enters a term that returns no results:
   * The following message should appear `No options to show`.

2. User deletes the search term:
   * The results should reset to the initial set (e.g., show all saved filters without any filtering).

3. User types invalid characters in the search field:
   * The system should handle special characters or unexpected input (e.g., space from keyboard) gracefully without breaking the UI or search functionality.

4. User enters a very long search term:
   * The search input field should not overflow or disrupt the layout when the user types in a long string.

5. User tries to search without any data available:
   * If no filters exist to search through, the input should not trigger any searches, and the user should be informed that no filters are available.

### Edge Use Cases:
1. User quickly enters and deletes multiple search terms:
   * The system should handle multiple fast search term changes without causing lag or errors.

2. User tries to input a very short search term (e.g., a single character):
   * The system should be able to handle cases where the search term is too short.

3. User interacts with the search while the UI is loading or rendering:
   * The system should handle cases where the search input is used while other parts of the UI are still loading or rendering, ensuring the search still works as expected.

### Accessibility Use Cases:
1. Keyboard navigation:
   * Users should be able to navigate to the search input using the Tab key and interact with it using Enter to trigger the search.

2. Screen reader compatibility:
   * When the user navigates to the search input, a screen reader should announce it as a search field, e.g., `Search for filters`.

3. Accessible placeholder text:
   * The screen reader should announce the placeholder text `Search` when the field is empty.

4. Clear button accessibility (X):
   * The clear button (X) should be accessible by `Tab` and announced as `Clear search field` when focused.
