### Positive Use Cases:
1. User clicks the `Clear` button to remove applied filters:
   * After a filter is applied and the `Clear` button appears, clicking the `Clear` button should remove all applied filters and reset the report.

2. User clears filter and sees a visual update:
   * Once the filter is cleared, the UI (e.g., the report) should update to reflect the absence of the filter, and the `Clear` button should disappear.

### Edge Use Cases:

1. User applies and clears filters multiple times in quick succession:
   * The application should handle rapid clicks on the `Clear` button and properly clear the filters, with the UI reflecting the change without errors.

2. User clicks `Clear` after applying multiple filters:
   * After applying multiple filters, the `Clear` button should clear all applied filters, and the UI should reset.

3. User clears filters and then opens the `Add Filter` modal again:
   * After clearing filters, the `Add Filter` button should remain visible and enabled, allowing the user to open the filter modal again.

### Accessibility Use Cases:
1. `Clear` button is focusable and accessible via keyboard navigation:
   * Users should be able to navigate to the `Clear` button using the Tab key.
   * The button should be focusable and clickable using the Enter key.

2. Screen readers announce the `Clear` button:
   * When using a screen reader, the `Clear` button should be properly announced with accessible text (e.g., `Clear filter`).
   * The screen reader should also announce the state of the button (enabled/disabled).

3. Button should be properly labeled for accessibility:
   * Ensure the `Clear` button has an appropriate aria-label (e.g., aria-label="Clear Filter").
   * The button should be visually distinguishable (with sufficient contrast) and has clear textual content.
