**Title:** Verify system-generated tag visual styling and accessibility

**Test Steps:**
1. Login to the workspace as an authenticated user.
2. Navigate to the Reports page.
3. Select a system-generated report to open report details page.
4. Locate the system-generated tag in the header section.

6. Check the tag's accessibility properties with screen reader tools.
7. Test keyboard navigation to the tag element.
