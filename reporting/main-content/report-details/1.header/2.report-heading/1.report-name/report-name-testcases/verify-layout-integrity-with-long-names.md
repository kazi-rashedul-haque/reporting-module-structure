**Title:** Verify very long report names don't break layout or cause horizontal scroll

**Test Steps:**
1. Login to the workspace as an authenticated user.
2. Navigate to the Reports page.
3. Create a report with an extremely long name (200+ characters).
4. Open the report details page.
5. Examine the header layout and overall page structure.
6. Check for any horizontal scrolling on the page.
7. Verify other header elements (buttons, metadata) remain properly positioned.
8. Test on different screen resolutions and browser widths.
9. Ensure the page remains usable and navigable.

**Expected Result:**
* Very long report names should not break the overall page layout.
* No horizontal scrolling should be introduced by the long name.
* Other header elements should remain properly positioned and accessible.
* The page should remain responsive and functional across different screen sizes.
* Layout integrity should be maintained regardless of name length.
