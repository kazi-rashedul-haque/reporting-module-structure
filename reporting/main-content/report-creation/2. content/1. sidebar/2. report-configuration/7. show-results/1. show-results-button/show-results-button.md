### Test Case Ideas

**Positive**:
1. Changing any configuration enables `Show Results` and shows `Save changes`.
2. Clicking `Show Results` generates new results.
3. Clicking `Save changes` persists configuration.
4. `Show Results` disabled when there are no changes made.

**Negative/Edge**:
1. Trying to click `Show Results` with no changes (remains disabled).
2. Saving changes twice rapidly (second is ignored).
3. `Save changes` hidden for system-generated reports.
4. Rapid toggling between changes and save actions.
