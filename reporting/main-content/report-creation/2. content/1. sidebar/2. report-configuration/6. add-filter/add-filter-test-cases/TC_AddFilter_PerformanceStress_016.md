# TC_AddFilter_PerformanceStress_016

## Title:
Verify Add Filter functionality performance under stress conditions and edge cases

## Pre-Condition:
1. User is logged into the reporting application
2. User is on the report creation page with completed basic configuration
3. System has sufficient test data for performance testing

## Test Steps:
1. Rapid clicking test:
   - Click Add Filter button multiple times rapidly
   - Click Add Nested Filter button rapidly multiple times
   - Rapidly open and close the modal
2. Create maximum complexity filter:
   - Add 10+ nested filters
   - Configure each with different operands and operators
   - Apply complex filter and measure response time
3. Large dataset filtering:
   - Apply filters to reports with large datasets (1000+ records)
   - Measure filter application time
   - Verify UI remains responsive
4. Multiple concurrent operations:
   - Open multiple browser tabs with filter operations
   - Test simultaneous filter applications
5. Memory usage testing:
   - Create and delete many filters repeatedly
   - Monitor for memory leaks
   - Test long-duration filter sessions
6. Dropdown performance with many options:
   - Test responsiveness when dropdowns have 100+ options
   - Verify search performance in large lists

## Expected Results:
1. Rapid clicking behavior:
   - No duplicate modals open from rapid Add Filter clicks
   - Add Nested Filter creates only one filter per click
   - No JavaScript errors from rapid interactions
   - UI remains responsive and stable
2. Complex filter performance:
   - Modal remains responsive with 10+ nested filters
   - Apply operation completes within 5 seconds for complex filters
   - No browser freezing or unresponsive scripts
   - Scrolling within modal works smoothly with many filters
3. Large dataset filtering:
   - Filter application completes within 10 seconds for 1000+ records
   - Progress indicators shown for long operations
   - UI remains interactive during filter processing
   - Memory usage stays within acceptable limits
4. Filter complexity limits:
   - System handles reasonable nesting levels (10+ levels)
   - Graceful degradation if limits are reached
   - Clear feedback if complexity limits are hit
5. Concurrent operations:
   - Multiple browser tabs can use filters simultaneously
   - No data corruption between concurrent sessions
   - Server handles multiple filter requests appropriately
6. Memory management:
   - No memory leaks during extended filter usage
   - Proper cleanup when modal is closed
   - Browser performance stable over time
7. Search performance:
   - Dropdown search responds instantly with <100 options
   - Search remains responsive with 1000+ options
   - Type-ahead filtering completes within 200ms
8. Error resilience:
   - System recovers gracefully from performance issues
   - No data loss during high-load conditions
   - User experience remains acceptable under stress
9. Resource usage:
   - CPU usage remains reasonable during filter operations
   - Network requests are optimized (no excessive API calls)
   - Client-side processing doesn't block UI thread
10. Timeout handling:
    - Appropriate timeouts for filter operations
    - User feedback for long-running operations
    - Ability to cancel long operations if needed
