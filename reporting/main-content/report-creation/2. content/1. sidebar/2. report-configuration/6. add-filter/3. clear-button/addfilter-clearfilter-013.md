**Title:** Verify Clear button removes applied filters and restores unfiltered report results

**Pre-Condition:**
1. User is logged into the reporting application
2. User is on the report creation page with completed basic configuration
3. Filters have been applied to the report (Add Filter modal has been used and filters applied)
4. Clear Filter button is visible in the sidebar

**Test Steps:**
1. Verify that filters are currently applied:
   - Filter indicator shows active filters
   - Report data reflects filtered results
   - Clear Filter button is visible
2. Click the "Clear" button next to the Add Filter button
3. Observe the filter removal and report updates
4. Verify the UI state after clearing
5. Test with different applied filter scenarios:
   - Single simple filter applied
   - Complex nested filters applied
   - Multiple filter groups applied
6. Reapply filters and clear multiple times

**Expected Results:**
1. Clear button visibility:
   - Visible when filters are applied (appears next to Add Filter button)
   - Not visible when no filters are applied
   - Labeled as "Clear" or "Clear Filter"
2. Clicking Clear button:
   - Immediately removes all applied filters
   - Updates report to show unfiltered results
   - Clear button disappears
   - Filter indicator is removed
3. Report data updates correctly:
   - Shows complete unfiltered dataset
   - Charts/visualizations reflect full data
   - No filtered data restrictions remain
4. UI state after clearing:
   - Add Filter button returns to initial state
   - No filter indicators remain
   - Report configuration (Report Type, Data Category, etc.) unchanged
   - Only filter settings are reset
5. Clear action behavior:
   - Works with any filter complexity level
   - Performs consistently across all filter types
   - Requires no confirmation dialog - immediate action
6. Opening Add Filter modal after clearing shows empty filter form
7. Clear functionality works regardless of how filters were applied (manual or saved filters)
