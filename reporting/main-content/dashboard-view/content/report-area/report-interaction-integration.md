# TC_REPORT_AREA_INT_003: Report Interaction Integration

**Description**: Verify report area integrates well with individual report interactions
**Pre-Condition**: Reports have interactive elements (drill-down, tooltips)
**Test Steps**:
1. Interact with reports within report area
2. Test various report interactions
3. Verify area-level vs report-level interactions
**Expected Result**:
- Report interactions work normally within area
- Area doesn't interfere with report functionality
- Report interactions don't break area layout
- Multiple reports can be interacted with independently
