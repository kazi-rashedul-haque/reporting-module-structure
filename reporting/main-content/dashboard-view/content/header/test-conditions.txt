Default Dashboard Behavior
If no custom dashboards exist, the system-generated "Legacy Dashboard" is displayed by default.
    - The "System-Generated" label is shown to indicate its origin.
    - The dashboard description is also displayed in this state.

Dashboard Header Actions
By default, the following action controls are visible in the dashboard header:
    - "Create Dashboard" button
    - "Actions" dropdown button
These elements allow users to create new dashboards and perform actions on the current dashboard, respectively.
